# OCS-API-for-Py
NextCloud OCS API for Python
Tested at Python 3.4 / NextCloud 12.0.3

Welcome to my shitty code > <

## Which API does it support?
- `User Provisioning API`: https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/12/admin_manual/configuration_user/user_provisioning_api.html
- `OCS Share API`: https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/12/developer_manual/core/ocs-share-api.html
- `GroupFolders`: https://github.com/nextcloud/groupfolders

## How to use?
Take a look at example.py and see NextCloud.py.
The code is not that difficult.

## It doesn't work
Please fix it on your own.
Then, please creat a pull request, if you have some time.
Maybe I pull it soon.
